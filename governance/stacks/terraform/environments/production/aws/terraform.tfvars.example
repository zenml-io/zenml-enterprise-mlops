# Example Terraform Variables for AWS Production
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and fill in your values
# DO NOT commit terraform.tfvars - it's in .gitignore

# AWS region (consider multi-region for HA)
region = "us-east-1"

# ZenML stack name (will be registered with your ZenML server)
stack_name = "aws-production"

# Deployment name (used in AWS resource naming)
deployment_name = "zenml-production"

# Orchestrator type: "sagemaker" or "skypilot"
# Recommendation: Use "sagemaker" for production (managed, scalable)
# Note: "local" is not recommended for production environments
orchestrator = "sagemaker"

# Optional: Additional tags (required for compliance and cost tracking)
tags = {
  Team        = "ml-platform"

# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
# ================================
#
# Before running terraform apply:
#
# 1. Configure remote state backend (uncomment in main.tf)
# 2. Set environment variables:
#    export ZENML_SERVER_URL="https://your-zenml-server.com"
#    export ZENML_API_KEY="<your-service-account-api-key>"
#    export AWS_PROFILE=production  # Or configure AWS credentials
#
# 3. Verify AWS credentials and permissions
# 4. Enable required AWS services:
#    - SageMaker (if using sagemaker orchestrator)
#    - S3
#    - ECR
#    - IAM
#
# 5. Review IAM roles and policies
# 6. Set up monitoring and alerting (CloudWatch)
# 7. Document deployment in change management system
# 8. Configure S3 versioning and lifecycle policies
# 9. Enable CloudTrail for audit logging
#
# Post-deployment:
# - Test stack connectivity: zenml stack describe aws-production
# - Run validation pipeline before promoting models
# - Set up automated monitoring dashboards
# - Configure backup procedures for critical data
