# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and fill in your values
# DO NOT commit terraform.tfvars - it's in .gitignore

# GCP project ID (use dedicated production project)

# GCP region (consider multi-region for HA)
region = "us-central1"

# ZenML stack name (will be registered with your ZenML server)
stack_name = "gcp-production"

# Deployment name (used in GCP resource naming)
deployment_name = "zenml-production"

# Orchestrator type: "vertex", "airflow", or "skypilot"
# Recommendation: Use "vertex" for production (managed, scalable)
# Note: "local" is not recommended for production environments

# Optional: Additional labels (required for compliance and cost tracking)

# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
# ================================
#
# Before running terraform apply:
#
# 1. Configure remote state backend (uncomment in main.tf)
# 2. Set environment variables:
#    export ZENML_SERVER_URL="https://your-zenml-server.com"
#    export ZENML_API_KEY="<your-service-account-api-key>"
#
# 3. Authenticate with GCP:
#    gcloud auth application-default login
#
# 4. Enable required GCP APIs:
#    - Vertex AI API (if using vertex orchestrator)
#    - Artifact Registry API
#    - Cloud Storage API
#    - IAM API
#
# 5. Review IAM permissions and service accounts
# 6. Set up monitoring and alerting
# 7. Document deployment in change management system
# 8. Schedule regular backups of Terraform state
#
# Post-deployment:
# - Test stack connectivity: zenml stack describe gcp-production
# - Run validation pipeline before promoting models
# - Set up automated monitoring dashboards
